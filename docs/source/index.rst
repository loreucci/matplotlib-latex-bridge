Welcome to matplotlib-latex-bridge!
===================================

This package is a collection of functions and shortcuts that can be used to create latex-ready images from matplotlib.

This aim of this library is not to be a replacement for matplotlib, but just to set sensible settings
in order to generate figures with readable text and with a font size that is consistent both among various figures
and with the rest of the text in the document.
